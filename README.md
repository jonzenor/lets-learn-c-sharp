# My C# Notes #

1. Concatinate with PLUS: var + var

2. Plus Equals to add to a variable: TotalPrice += tax;
 - This is called a Compound Assignment Operator and works with all basic math opertors (+*/-)

3. The increment operator can be used before the variable (i.e. ++ThisVar) instead of just after the variable (ThisVar++)
 - This can make a difference with the order that is used.
 - - A = B++ will assign B's value to A, and then will increment B.
 - - A = ++B will increment B, and then assign the new value of B to A.
